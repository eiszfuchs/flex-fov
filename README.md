Modifying [this minecraft mod] to select allow any FOV 0-360Â°, but intelligently
choosing the best projections (as seen in [blinky]).

## Quick Start

__This currently only works for Windows__.  Run the following to start a game with
the mod installed.

```
gradlew.bat runClient
```

> __NOTE__: Prior to running this, I had Minecraft and Minecraft Forge installed (both 1.11.2).
> But I am not actually sure if this is required, since I believe this gradle
> setup is building the entire game itself from decompiled sources?

## IntelliJ Setup

IntelliJ can be setup to allow autocomplete, which is useful for exploring the
Minecraft/Forge APIs in-place.  If you don't wish to use an IDE, you can explore
the APIs the old-fashioned way using this [Forge javadoc][javadoc] (outdated but
probably mostly relevant).

You have to create your own IntelliJ project since it cannot be easily
version-controlled. I loosely followed [these instructions][intellij]:

1. Run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
1. Open IntelliJ
1. 'Import Project' > choose our `build.gradle` file
1. View > Tool Windows > Project
1. Right click our `*.iml` file > Import Module
1. Run `./gradlew genIntellijRuns`
1. Restart IntelliJ
1. Run > Edit Configurations
1. Application > Minecraft Client > Use classpath of module > `*_main`
1. Run > Run 'Minecraft Client'

The game should start with our mod installed.

## Deploying

This will build a jar file that users can install.  (Not currently working
when I try to install to a 1.11.2 forge mods folder.)

```sh
gradlew.bat build
# outputs a jar to build/libs
```
